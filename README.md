# Landing Page Project



### Instructions & Aim of Project

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. 

The aim is to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This requires modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

### Project development
 
 Almost all the coding took place in the Javascript file. Some small style adjustments in the CSS file.

 Steps followed:

 * defining global variables.
 
 * creating the li elements (nav items) and adding them to the DOM.
 
 * listening for 'click' events on nav items and scrolling down to the corresponding section of the page.
 
 * identifying which particular section is on the viewport.

 * connecting nav item to the section currently on the viewport.
 
 *  adding active class to the section on the viewport and the corresponding nav item and removing active class when not on the viewport.

 * calling my makeActive() function when user scrolls the page.
