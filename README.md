# Landing Page Project



## Instructions & Aim of Project

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. The aim is to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This requires modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

## Project development
 
 Almost all the coding took place in the Javascript file. Some small style adjustments in the CSS file.

 Step 1: defining global variables.
 Step 2: creating the li (nav items) elements and adding them to the DOM.
 Step 3: listening for 'click' events on nav items and scrolling down to the corresponding section of the page.
 Step 4: identifying which particular section is on the viewport.
 Step 5: connecting nav item to the section currently on the viewport.
 Step 6: adding active class to the section on the viewport and the corresponding nav item and removing active class when not on the viewport.
 Step 7: calling my makeActive() function when user scrolls the page.
